## API Key

You will be prompted to enter your Google Generative AI API key when you run the command for the first time. Ensure that you store it securely, as it is required for generating code snippets.


## RUN ON TERMINAL OR BASH

Run on terminal or on bash using following command
```bash
codegen
```

## Example

```bash
$ codegen
Describe the code snippet you need (e.g., "JWT login"): JWT login
Enter the programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python): JavaScript
Enter the file name to save the snippet (e.g., snippet.js): jwtLogin.js
```
This will generate a jwtLogin.js file containing the code snippet for JWT login in JavaScript.
